			<p>Bassets are scent hounds, meaning that they were bred to hunt by following the scent of their prey.</p>
			<ul>
				<p><span>Dog Breed Group</span>: Hound Dogs</P>
				<p><span>Height</span>: Up to 1 foot 2 inches tall at the shoulder</p>
				<p><span>Weight</span>: 45 to 60 Pounds</p>
				<p><span>Lifespan</span>: 10 to 12 years</p>
			</ul>
				<div class="houndbody">Their short-legged appearance is the result of a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia. Despite his large size, the Basset believes he's a lap dog and will do his best to fit in yours.
